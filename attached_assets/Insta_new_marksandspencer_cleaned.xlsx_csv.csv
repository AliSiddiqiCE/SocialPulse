Did you know... cold water takes a little longer than hot water to extract the flavour from coffee, but the advantage of this is that the final brew is smoother and less bitter!

Simply add a bag to a jug or container with 600ml cold water and leave in the fridge overnight (we recommend 18-24 hours), then pour yourself a fresh glass of cold brew coffee, or mix with chocolate milk and our Foodhall famous chocolate cream for a delicious iced mocha! ☀

Looking to treat someone special on Mother’s Day this weekend? This Apple & Elderflower Spritz is the perfect refreshing sip: easy, elegant and oh-so-delicious!  I used the fragrant M&S Elderflower Liqueur made with hand-picked elderflowers as well as lemongrass and blackcurrant buds for those aromatic floral notes. And to make this cocktail extra special I used the M&S Edible Viola Flowers to make some cute sphere ice cubes.  These stunning Gin Deco glasses are also from M&S, perfect for spring and summer spritzes! 
 
Recipe
 50ml M&S Elderflower Liqueur
 50ml M&S Sparkling British Apple Spring Water (find this with the on-the-go drinks by the sandwiches and salads)
 100ml M&S Extra Dry Prosecco (you can also use 150ml if you prefer a drier spritz)
Serve over ice, stir and enjoy!

So I popped around today and took a look at her M&S App. I showed her how to input her Date of Birth in her personal details and save this ahead of her birthday next month, as I wanted to make sure she updated it in time!

Do remember that you will be able to collect your free birthday gift, whether that's a bouquet of flowers or a bag of Percy Pigs at any point during your birthday month. Just check Sparks in the M&S app before you head to store.

In a bowl, mix the almond flour, oat flour, flaxseeds, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
In a blender, blend the cottage cheese, honey, egg, almond extract, and olive oil.
Gradually fold the wet ingredients into the dry mixture until fully combined.
Spoon a little batter into each muffin case, add a little dollop of almond butter to the center, then cover with more batter.
Sprinkle flaked almonds on top of each muffin.
Bake for 15-18 minutes, until golden and risen. Allow to cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container for up to 7 days.

I used @marksandspencerfood @marksandspencerfood Spicy Korean Style Chicken Thighs and created a dish inspired by the popular dish in Mauritius 'Bol Renversé' also known as 'magic bowl ' or 'upside down bowl'. One of my favourite dishes from back home! Try this for a delicious dinner, date night in or something special when you want to impress your guests  

M&S have launched a huge new Slow Cooked range with the aim of maximum flavour with minimal effort. They have over 35 products in the range! They use the same steps that a top restaurant would take to ensure only the best quality product hits the M&S shelves! 

Traditionally this dish is a chop suey served with a fried egg and rice but the way that the dish is plated is what makes it unique. Served into an upside-down bowl over a flat plate, lifting the bowl and revealing a 3-layer dish! The Korean Chicken worked brilliantly with this  

Ingredients serves 2-3
Spicy Korean style chicken thighs
A pack of broccoli, carrot, baby corn & fine beans
Basmati rice with cooked or ready-made eggs, fried to your liking
Chopped spring onions and sesame seeds for garnish

Method 
• Follow instructions on the packaging for Korean thighs, once cooked break into pieces using a fork and remove the bones. 
•⁠ ⁠Steam the veg, slice the carrots and corn and mix with the chicken. Add a few tsp of water for extra sauce. 
• Place a fried egg in your bowl as shown in my reel. 
•⁠ ⁠Then a layer of the chicken and vegetables. 
•⁠ ⁠The last layer is rice! Fill your bowl enough so when you turn it upside down it's securely in place. Just imagine it like building a sandcastle! 
•⁠ ⁠Garnish with spring onions and sesame seeds. 

DELICIOUS!

These slow cooked pulled chicken fajita tacos are truly one of the best things I have EVER made  

Simply served up with a quick high protein chipotle yoghurt dip, they are beyond more-ish and using the new Slow Cooked share and shred Fajita Chicken from @marksandspencerfood means they’re criminally easy too 

The chicken is slow cooked to perfection using a technique M&S have perfectly honed for YEARS, and also only uses staple ingredients you’d have in your cupboards anyway - so you KNOW you’re getting the highest quality & maximum taste 

 Hit SAVE to give these a go for dinner ❤️

 Serves 2 

✨ 1 x 490g pack of @marksandspencerfood slow cooked Fajita spiced Chicken 
✨ x 4 mini–Flour Tortilla Wraps 
✨ 40g grated mozzarella cheese
✨ 1/2 an onion, diced
✨ A few leaves of fresh coriander  

For the sauce: 

✨ 100g 0% fat Greek yoghurt
✨ 1/2 tsp of chipotle paste
✨ 1/4 of a lime, juiced 

Cook your delicious fajita chicken according to the packaging instructions, then shred with two forks.
Spray a frying pan with some cooking spray, then press one side of your tortilla into the shredded chicken to coat in the juices, and place into the pan. Sprinkle half of the tortilla with your cheese, add on some of your shredded chicken, then close and press down.
Repeat with the remaining tortillas, then fry over a medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes per side or until lovely and crispy.
While they’re frying make your sauce by mixing the Greek yoghurt, chipotle paste and lime together in a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and adjust to taste.
Serve up the tacos immediately with your dip, the diced onion and coriander, plus your favourite other toppings.

Then simply dive on in and enjoy! You can grab the slow cooked fajita chicken in your local @marksandspencerfood now along with lots of other delicious dishes in the new slow cooked range

2 eggs 
120g thick Greek yoghurt (0% or full fat) 
50g spinach
1 banana shallot 
1 clove garlic
Pinch nutmeg
30g feta
1 tbsp chopped dill
Wholemeal pita to serve
Optional: pomegranate seeds and mixed seeds to serve 

Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Gently lower the eggs into the water and boil for 6 minutes. Transfer them immediately into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking. Let them sit for 5 minutes, then carefully peel and set aside.
Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Sauté the chopped shallot until soft. Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. Stir in the spinach and cook until wilted. Remove from the heat, squeeze out any excess moisture, and chop finely. In a bowl, mix the spinach with Greek yoghurt, crumbled feta, nutmeg, chopped dill, and plenty of black pepper.

Spread the spinach-yoghurt mixture onto a plate. Slice the soft-boiled eggs in half and place them on top. Sprinkle with mixed seeds and pomegranate seeds, if using. Serve with a warm wholemeal pita for scooping.",2025-01-31T18:18:10.000Z,1673

As always let me know what recipes you want on the feed! 

AD Filled with lots of Eat Well ingredients that you can find in M&S Foodhalls by simply looking for the flower on the pack.

I started off by making some rhubarb and custard pots. I love to make my own compote as it allows me to adjust the sugar content. I added some fresh orange zest, and once cooked down, I layered it with the M&S Good Gut vanilla kefir and their new Brain Food granola with iron and zinc. These are perfect for prepping, as they turn kind of bircher like! Washed down with a shortbread tea, obviously.

For lunch, I made a take on Turkish eggs but spanakopita style. I sautéed garlic, shallots, and spinach. Mixed it with the M&S Greek yoghurt, feta, fresh dill, nutmeg, lots of pepper, and salt. I topped it with oozy eggs, a sprinkle of the new M&S Eat Well 35+ Gut Booster mix, pomegranate seeds, and paired it with a wholegrain pita.

I also tried the new M&S Brain Ball, which is the best-tasting health ball I’ve ever had, loved the gooey almond butter. 

For dinner, I made a take on the viral crispy rice salad. I used the Caledonian Gold salmon fillets, which contain a week’s worth of your omega 3! love! I pressed the precooked rice down into the pan and toasted it until golden. Then, I mixed it with high protein edamame, cucumber, avocado, spring onion, and a soy honey dressing. This was so good, and I would definitely make it again!

Well fed and ready for bed.

+ some extra mushroom goodness in the form of M&S’s YAY! Mushroom range. They’ve paired up with Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew to bring out lions’ mane and reishi drinks!
 
Ingredients
      •     1 tbsp olive oil
      •     1 onion
      •     2 garlic cloves
      •     2 carrots
      •     2 celery sticks
      •     300g chestnut mushrooms pulsed in a blender
      •     1 tsp dried oregano
      •     1 tsp dried thyme
      •     2 tbsp tomato paste
      •     1 can (400g) chopped tomatoes
      •     1 can (400g) tinned lentils, drained and rinsed
      •     500ml vegetable stock
      •     100ml red wine (optional)
      •     1 tbsp soy sauce
      •     1 bay leaf (optional)
      •     250g dry pasta
      •     500ml water, as needed
      •     Salt and black pepper, to taste
      •     Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish
      •     Parmesan or nutritional yeast, for serving (optional)
 
Method
      1.    Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, carrots, and celery. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened.
      2.    Add the chopped chestnut mushrooms and cook for 8-10 minutes until they release their liquid and brown slightly. (To save time you can add all vegetables at the same time)
      3.    Stir in oregano, thyme and tomato paste. Cook for 1-2 minutes to combine. If using, pour in red wine and let it simmer until reduced by half.
      4.    Add the chopped tomatoes, tinned lentils, vegetable stock & soy sauce. Stir to combine.
      5.    Add the dry pasta directly to the pot. Pour in enough water to just cover the pasta (about 500ml). Stir well and bring the mixture to a boil.
      6.    Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-12 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent sticking. Add more water if the mixture becomes too thick before the pasta is fully cooked.
      7. Once the pasta is cooked and the sauce is thickened, remove the bay leaf and adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper.
      8.    Serve hot, garnished with fresh parsley and grated Parmesan or nutritional yeast, if you like!

Eating a balanced diet to support brain function and health is an area of hugely growing interest. 

So to make it easier to spot the foods that help, we’ve created our colourful new Brain Food range!

All products in the range contain at least two of these nutrients, carry our M&S Eat Well health seal of approval, and taste delicious!
